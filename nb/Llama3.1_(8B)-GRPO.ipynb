One of the key differences between Shiism and mainstream Sunni Islam lies in their view of the Islamic leaders after the death of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. In Shiism, many believe that the first few leaders were legitimate successors, but the period of the leadership of Uthman and particularly, the ascension of Uthman's successor Ali's rebels (To Ali ibn Abu Talib), who was appointed by the prophet but did not receive the widespread recognition and popularity of his cousin Uthman were considered illegitimate successors. However, Ali's leadership period was greatly respected and latter Ali ibn Abu Talib became the fourth Caliph of Islam. Later Ali was then assassinated and replaced by Muawiya, marking the beginning of the Umayyad caliphate. He is respected very much for his ability to maintain unity, for supporting the holy book\n",

Here are a few ways to approximate pi:\\n\\n**Method 1: Archimedes\\' Method**\\n\\nArchimedes, a Greek mathematician, used the method of exhaustion to approximate pi in the 3rd century BC. He inscribed and circumscribed polygons around a circle and calculated the perimeter of these polygons to find an approximation of pi.\\n\\n**Method 2: Taylor Series**\\n\\nThe Taylor series expansion of the arctangent function can be used to approximate pi:\\n\\nœÄ/4 = 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 - ...\\n\\nThis series converges slowly, but can be used to get a good approximation of pi.\\n\\n**Method 3: Leibniz Formula**\\n\\nThe Leibniz formula is another infinite series that can be used to approximate pi:\\n\\nœÄ/4 = 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 - ...\\n\\nThis series converges even more slowly than the Taylor series.\\n\\n**Method 4: Monte Carlo Method**\\n\\nThe Monte Carlo method involves generating random points within a circle and counting the ratio of points within the circle to the total number of points. This ratio is then multiplied by 4 to get an approximation of pi.\\n\\n**Method 5: Gauss-Legendre Algorithm**\\n\\nThe Gauss-Legendre algorithm is a fast and accurate method for calculating pi. It involves using a recursive formula to calculate the arithmetic-geometric mean of two numbers.\\n\\n**Example Code**\\n\\nHere is an example of the Monte Carlo method in Python:\\n```python\\nimport random\\nimport math\\n\\ndef calculate_pi(num_points):\\n    points_inside_circle = 0\\n    for _ in range(num_points):\\n        x, y = random.uniform(-1, 1), random.uniform(-1, 1)\\n        if x**2 + y**2 <= 1:\\n            points_inside_circle += 1\\n    return 4 * points_inside_circle / num_points\\n\\nnum_points = 1000000\\npi_estimate = calculate_pi(num_points)\\nprint(\"Estimated value of pi:\", pi_estimate)\\n```\\n\\n**Calculating Pi to 10,000 Digits**\\n\\nCalculating pi to 10,000 digits requires a much'"
